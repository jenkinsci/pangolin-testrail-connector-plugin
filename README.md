=============================================
![](https://docs.railflow.io/img/banner.png)

**Pangolin is now Railflow!**

We are pleased to announce that Pangolin has been redesigned from the ground up and is now called [Railflow]("https://railflow.io/")  
  
Reason why we did this:

1.  Simplify the overall installation. (Railflow requires no server!)
2.  Support for all CICD systems like Jenkins, TeamCity, Github, Gitlab, CircleCI etc.
3.	New and improved pricing and licensing options.
4.	Tons of new features and capabilities.

The Railflow Jenkins Plugin can be downloaded from [our official page](https://railflow.io/resources/downloads).

Please visit [Railflow](https://railflow.io/) for the details.
       
Railflow Documentation is available [here](https://docs.railflow.io/docs/intro)
